I am an assistant professor (tenure track) at the University of Innsbruck in the [department of Computer Science](https://www.uibk.ac.at/informatik/index.html.de).  

**Research Interests** My research interests lie in the area of cryptography and its applications. I am interested in designing cryptographic primitives, cryptanalysis, and application of cryptography in security and privacy. I am also interested in statistical machine learning and its interplay with cryptography and security.

**Prior Positions** I was a lecturer (2020 - 09/2023) at the Alpen-Adria Unviersity Klagenfurt in the Cybersecurity Research group led by [Prof. Elisabeth Oswald](https://www.aau.at/team/oswald-elisabeth/). Prior to that, I was a senior research associate (09/2017 - 2019) at the Unviersity of Bristol, UK in the cryptography research group, and a postdoc researcher (06/2014 - 04/2017) at the Technical University of Denmark in the Cybersecurity group hosted by [Prof. Christian Rechberger](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/person/christian-rechberger/).

I received PhD in Computer Science from the University of Luxembourg in 2014. My doctoral research topic was security aspects of symmetric-key primitives and my thesis supervisor was [Prof. Alex Biryukov](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en/people/alexei-biryukov/).

My academic background is in Mathematics. I received master's (M.Sc from the Indian Institute of Technology) and bachelor's (B.Sc with Hons.) degrees in Mathematics. I also hold a master's (M.Tech from the Indian Statistical Institute) degree in Computer Science.
