I am a tenure-track assistant professor at the University of Innsbruck ([Department of Computer Science](https://www.uibk.ac.at/informatik/index.html.de)).  

**Research Interests** My research interests lie in the area of cryptography and its applications. I am interested in designing cryptographic primitives, cryptanalysis, and applications of cryptography in security and privacy.

I was a lecturer at the Alpen-Adria Unviersity Klagenfurt in the Cybersecurity Research group led by [Prof. Elisabeth Oswald](https://www.aau.at/team/oswald-elisabeth/). Prior to that, I was a senior research associate (2017 - 2019) at the Unviersity of Bristol, UK in the cryptography research group, and a postdoc researcher (2014 - 2017) at the Technical University of Denmark in the Cybersecurity group hosted by [Prof. Christian Rechberger](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/person/christian-rechberger/).

I received PhD in Computer Science from the University of Luxembourg in 2014. My doctoral research topic was security aspects of symmetric-key primitives and I was advised by [Prof. Alex Biryukov](https://wwwen.uni.lu/recherche/fstm/dcs/membres/alex_biryukov).

My academic background is in Mathematics. I received master's (M.Sc from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur) and bachelor's (B.Sc with Hons. from the University of Calcutta) degrees in Mathematics. I also hold a master's (M.Tech from the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta) degree in Computer Science.
